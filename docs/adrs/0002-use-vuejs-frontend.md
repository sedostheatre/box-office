# Use TypeScript/VueJS for frontend

## Status

proposed

## Context

We're starting out the system, need to decide on basic set up requirements, like tech stacks. 
We have a disparate tech stack within Sedos, including C# for the website, Python for various membership tools and a mix of other frameworks and smaller utilities.
We need a broadly supported tech stack to enable future development safely, as well as providing an interesting tech stack for contributors.

VueJS with TypeScript meets all our needs and should enable complex frontends where required, with SSR/good performance.

## Decision

Adopt TypeScript/VueJS as default frontend technologies.

## Consequences

We have a default tech stack for our frontend code base.
